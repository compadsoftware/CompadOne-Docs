Our new Compad One Business platform offers various applications such as a web-based management and reporting portal, API, and various apps such as a Point of Sale App, an Order App, etc.
To access one or more applications on the platform or the platform's management portal, users must register and authenticate themselves. 
Depending on their rights, registered users can register one or more companies/organisations (tenants). Each tenant has its own administration.
Because user authorization is important for the use of the various applications, it is necessary to set up a minimum user registration and authorization at this stage.# Authetication
